# Weather Prediction Web App

## Overview

This is a comprehensive weather prediction web application built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn. The app allows users to upload weather datasets, explore and visualize the data, train multiple machine learning models, and make weather forecasts. It provides an interactive interface for data analysis, model comparison, and prediction visualization with features like data cleaning, correlation analysis, time series plotting, geographic location mapping, and model performance evaluation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
